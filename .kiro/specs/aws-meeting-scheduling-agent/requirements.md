# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AWS-native Meeting Scheduling Agent is an AI-powered system that automates meeting management across Gmail and Outlook calendars. The agent detects scheduling conflicts, prioritizes meetings based on user preferences, proposes optimal meeting times, and handles booking/rescheduling with automated confirmations. Built for hackathon deployment, it leverages Amazon Bedrock with Claude Sonnet 4.5 and AgentCore primitives, providing a production-ready solution with multi-tenant architecture foundations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: AI Agent Core Functionality

**User Story:** As a busy professional, I want an AI agent to automatically manage my meeting schedules across multiple calendar platforms, so that I can focus on my work without worrying about scheduling conflicts or missed opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent receives a meeting request THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Bedrock Claude Sonnet 4.5 for reasoning and decision-making
2. WHEN processing scheduling tasks THEN the system SHALL utilize at least one Amazon Bedrock AgentCore primitive for tool orchestration
3. WHEN making scheduling decisions THEN the agent SHALL provide natural language rationale in audit logs
4. WHEN conflicts are detected THEN the agent SHALL propose top 3 alternative time slots ranked by fit score
5. IF auto-booking is disabled THEN the agent SHALL only suggest meeting times and require user confirmation

### Requirement 2: Multi-Platform Calendar Integration

**User Story:** As a user with both Gmail and Outlook accounts, I want to connect both calendar systems to the agent, so that I can manage all my meetings from a single interface regardless of the platform.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN connecting Gmail THEN the system SHALL use OAuth 2.0 with minimal scopes (calendar read/write, gmail.send)
2. WHEN connecting Outlook THEN the system SHALL use Microsoft Graph OAuth 2.0 with scopes (Calendars.ReadWrite, Mail.Send)
3. WHEN retrieving availability THEN the system SHALL normalize events to ISO 8601 format with timezone awareness
4. WHEN both platforms are connected THEN the system SHALL provide unified availability view across all calendars
5. WHEN creating events THEN the system SHALL support creation on either Google Calendar or Microsoft 365 Calendar
6. WHEN tokens expire THEN the system SHALL automatically refresh using stored refresh tokens

### Requirement 3: Conflict Detection and Resolution

**User Story:** As a user with a busy schedule, I want the agent to automatically detect scheduling conflicts and propose solutions, so that I never have overlapping meetings or missed appointments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scanning calendars THEN the system SHALL identify all scheduling conflicts across connected platforms
2. WHEN conflicts involve high-priority meetings THEN the system SHALL propose alternative times via email and UI
3. WHEN rescheduling is needed THEN the system SHALL find optimal slots based on attendee availability and user preferences
4. WHEN conflicts are resolved THEN the system SHALL send confirmation notifications to all affected parties
5. IF no suitable alternatives exist THEN the system SHALL escalate to human decision-making

### Requirement 4: Intelligent Meeting Prioritization

**User Story:** As a professional with varying meeting importance levels, I want the agent to understand and respect my meeting priorities, so that important meetings are protected and less critical ones can be moved when conflicts arise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN evaluating meetings THEN the system SHALL assign priority scores based on attendees, subject, and user-defined rules
2. WHEN VIP contacts are involved THEN the system SHALL automatically assign high priority to those meetings
3. WHEN priority conflicts occur THEN the system SHALL protect higher-priority meetings and suggest moving lower-priority ones
4. WHEN learning from user feedback THEN the system SHALL adjust priority weights based on user corrections
5. IF meeting types are specified THEN the system SHALL apply type-specific priority rules

### Requirement 5: Automated Communication

**User Story:** As someone who wants to maintain professional communication, I want the agent to automatically send well-crafted meeting confirmations and updates, so that all participants are properly informed without manual effort.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN meetings are booked THEN the system SHALL compose and send confirmation emails via Gmail or Outlook
2. WHEN meetings are rescheduled THEN the system SHALL notify all attendees with clear before/after details
3. WHEN cancellations occur THEN the system SHALL send appropriate cancellation notices with brief explanations
4. WHEN auto-send is disabled THEN the system SHALL draft emails for user review before sending
5. IF email threads exist THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation continuity using thread IDs

### Requirement 6: User Preference Management

**User Story:** As a user with specific working patterns and preferences, I want to configure my scheduling rules and constraints, so that the agent respects my work-life balance and meeting preferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting working hours THEN the system SHALL never book meetings outside specified times unless override is enabled
2. WHEN configuring buffer times THEN the system SHALL maintain specified gaps between consecutive meetings
3. WHEN defining focus blocks THEN the system SHALL protect these periods from meeting scheduling
4. WHEN specifying VIP lists THEN the system SHALL prioritize meetings with designated important contacts
5. WHEN setting default meeting lengths THEN the system SHALL use these durations for new meeting proposals
6. IF meeting type preferences exist THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate duration and location defaults

### Requirement 7: Security and Privacy

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my calendar data and authentication tokens to be securely stored and managed, so that my sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing OAuth tokens THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AWS KMS customer-managed keys
2. WHEN managing secrets THEN the system SHALL store client credentials in AWS Secrets Manager
3. WHEN processing PII THEN the system SHALL minimize data collection and redact sensitive information from logs
4. WHEN accessing AWS services THEN the system SHALL use least-privilege IAM policies
5. WHEN rotating credentials THEN the system SHALL support automatic secret rotation via Secrets Manager
6. IF audit trails are required THEN the system SHALL maintain comprehensive logs without exposing sensitive data

### Requirement 8: Web Interface and User Experience

**User Story:** As a user who needs to monitor and control the agent's activities, I want a clean web interface to view my schedule, configure preferences, and review agent decisions, so that I maintain oversight of my meeting management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display unified availability timeline across all connected calendars
2. WHEN viewing conflicts THEN the system SHALL show clear conflict indicators with proposed resolutions
3. WHEN connecting accounts THEN the system SHALL provide secure OAuth flows for both Google and Microsoft
4. WHEN reviewing agent actions THEN the system SHALL display audit logs with natural language explanations
5. WHEN configuring preferences THEN the system SHALL provide intuitive forms for all scheduling rules and constraints
6. IF testing is needed THEN the system SHALL provide a test-run feature to validate agent behavior

### Requirement 9: AWS Infrastructure and Deployment

**User Story:** As a developer deploying this system, I want a fully automated AWS infrastructure setup that follows best practices, so that the application can be reliably deployed and scaled in production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying infrastructure THEN the system SHALL use AWS CDK TypeScript for all resource provisioning
2. WHEN handling authentication THEN the system SHALL use Amazon Cognito user pools for user management
3. WHEN processing API requests THEN the system SHALL use API Gateway HTTP APIs with Lambda function handlers
4. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use DynamoDB tables with appropriate partition and sort keys
5. WHEN handling events THEN the system SHALL use EventBridge for periodic scans and SQS for async processing
6. WHEN serving the frontend THEN the system SHALL use S3 static hosting with CloudFront distribution
7. IF monitoring is required THEN the system SHALL implement CloudWatch logging with structured JSON and correlation IDs

### Requirement 10: Hackathon Compliance and Deliverables
